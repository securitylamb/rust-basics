Introduction
Rust is a statically-typed systems programming language known for its focus on safety, performance, and concurrency. It was designed to provide low-level control over system resources without sacrificing high-level abstractions. This guide will take you through the fundamentals of Rust and help you build a solid foundation for writing efficient and reliable code.

Getting Started
To get started with Rust, follow these steps:

Install Rust by following the instructions on the official Rust website.
Clone this repository to access code examples and exercises.
bash
